# tiffany-in-ct-v2.0
This rails application is a functional database within the intent to open-source
material and data about Tiffany Stained Glass Windows in the State of Connecticut.

The acquisition by my museum of a stained glass Tiffany Studios Window from a small church prompted inquiry to other nearby gems. Discovery of citation that in 1910, more than 75 Stained Glass Tiffany Windows existed in Connecticut a decade ago ensured that the task of identifying and documenting them would be an enormous undertaking, but one worthy of the endeavor.

The site was designed so that a user can sign in and register a new site, uploading windows. This database allows researchers accessibility to all of that information which is easily filtered in the index views.
